# Refactor
- Code as an addable Attribute to Nodes
- Events as an alternative to input callbacks & way to communicate between elements.

- Remove 1-node:n-worlds correspondance, nodes should only belong to 1 world at any time. Duplication should occur otherwise.

- Add oop input-manager to reduce complexity.
