## VertexD is a hobby glTF Renderer/Engine, created to learn DLang & OpenGL

#### Requirements:
- Dlang compiler [(eg dmd)](https://dlang.org/).
- Package manager [dub](https://dub.pm/getting_started) (included with dmd compiler).
- [GLFW library files](https://www.glfw.org/); `glfw3dll.lib` to build, `glfw3.dll` to run.

Dmd can also be installed using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) using `choco install dmd`.
